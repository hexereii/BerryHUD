# Description

Originally made by Colly, so all credit goes to him really, I just updated it.  
  
The hud is pretty clean overall with no real intrusive features, but still functional. I'm bad at this so just check the screenshots I guess.

# Credits

All real credit to Colly, I'll be updating the hud from now on but he did all the hard work.  
  
Safe.

# Special Thanks

My friends opte, SFAN, and Lethal that tested my hud for bugs. La\_maison for inspiring the loading screen, and pwny for the sourcescheme. Thanks guys."
