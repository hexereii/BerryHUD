# Description

Note: The screenshots are horribly out of date.  
A stylish, modern-looking HUD that aims to remove clutter and improve how easy it is to read valuable information.  
  
"one of the nicest HUDs i've ever used" - guy on teamfortress.tv  
"This is one of the cleanest and neatest huds I've seen" - another guy on teamfortress.tv  
  
You like right angles? 'Cus I've got right angles, baby! Want to change a little something? Well, I've got tons of officially supported customizations that might just be what you're looking for.  
I always update it in a timely fashion, and if I make any drastic changes to the design, I'll usually include the old design as a customization option.  
  
All the screenshots except one are in cl\_hud\_minmode 1, but it also supports cl\_hud\_minmode 0 which has larger backgrounds and icons.  
  
Seriously, it would mean the world to me if you use the HUD seeing as I put a lot of time and effort into. Lots of late nights updating :) This is my baby.
