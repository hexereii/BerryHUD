# Description

yayahud is the next generation of yahud and takyahud, keeping with the original guidelines without just being a carbon copy updated just for compatibility.  
  
Sometimes I forget to upload the attachment on huds.tf. If the HUD isn't working for you please try downloading the latest file from the thread on TFTV (<http://www.teamfortress.tv/26847/yayahud>). If you can, please also leave a message in that thread to remind me to update the HUD here. It's hard work!
