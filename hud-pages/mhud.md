# Description

A HUD focused on looking clean while maintaining a fair bit of the default HUD's layout.  
  
I strongly encourage feedback, as there are many parts of the HUD I am on the fence about keeping or changing. If you do decide to leave feedback, please do so either on the teamfortresstv thread or in a tftv PM.
