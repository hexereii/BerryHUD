# Description


Simplistic HUD created by a Medic main, with the purpose of visibility, while still being noticeable. Heavily based on SunsetHUD/PeachHUD.  
  
The files are a mess since this is my first HUD, I wouldn't suggest trying to modify things unless you know what you're doing.  
The customizations folder is a left-over from the HUDs it's based on, they are not really functional. I will get around to adding functional customizations some day.  
  
I do not know if this HUD properly works on other monitor resolutions than 16:9, use at your own risk if you do not use 16:9. Same goes for Mac/Linux. I may update it later with proper support, but there's no guarantee until I can find time to.
