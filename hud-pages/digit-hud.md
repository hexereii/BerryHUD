# Description

A clean and fresh TF2 HUD made from scratch, inspired by the spectator hud used at Insomnia61 to be used in normal gameplay.

**Important information**:

- Only supports "16:9 resolutions" (for the moment).
- Pending to edit: mvm, halloween, robot destruction & passtime.
- Custom spectator tournament panels for 9v9 included in "`resource/ui/spectatortournament_9v9`", default is 6v6.
- Install the fonts included in "resource/fonts" folder. (if needed).

A huge shout-out to Raysfire for the tutorials, Doodles's website for the information regarding each hud file and to the people in the tftv forums for helping me out with some questions related to editing files.  

Also thanks a lot for the inspiration to all the hud creators out there.

Enjoy!

UPDATE: `cl_hud_minmode 1` option is now available.

Also thanks a lot for the inspiration to all hud creators out there, I always wanted to make my own TF2 hud and I finally did it after all these years.
