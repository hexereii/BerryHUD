# voidHUD Classic

I started designing it as a personal modded stock HUD, but it eventually evolved into what it is today. It features a clean design, with simple to read font/colors.

This is the older version of voidHUD. I still maintain it, but I separated the downloads since I know some people who prefer the older styles that were not brought over to the new voidHUD rewrite.
